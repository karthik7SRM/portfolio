    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <p>
      I am not locked into any scheduled hackathons or events at the moment.
      This is intentional. It allows me to focus deeply on meaningful
      projects, research work, and long-term collaborations rather than
      short-term participation.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <h2>What I am Open To</h2>

    <ul class="list">
      <li>Applied data science or ML projects with real-world impact</li>
      <li>Backend or system-oriented engineering work</li>
      <li>Research-driven problem statements (academic or industry)</li>
      <li>Collaborative builds with strong technical ownership</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="block highlight">
    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>
      I prefer working on fewer problems with deeper ownership. This approach
      allows me to deliver higher-quality outcomes and gain practical insights
      that translate directly into production-level thinking.

    <p>
      If you are looking for someone to contribute seriously to a project or
      research initiative, I am open to discussing opportunities.
