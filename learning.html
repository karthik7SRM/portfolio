  <h1>My Learning System</h1>
  <p>How I learn, apply, and retain without mugging.</p>

    <h2>Foundation: CBSE & Core Thinking</h2>
    <p>
      My academic foundation is rooted in the CBSE system, which emphasized
      conceptual clarity, logical reasoning, and structured problem-solving.
      This shaped my ability to understand <strong>why something works</strong>,
      not just how to reproduce answers.

  <div class="block">
    <h2>System-Based Learning (Not Syllabus-Based)</h2>
    <p>
      I dont treat subjects as isolated chapters. I approach learning as
      interconnected systems — inputs, transformations, outputs, constraints,
      and failure points. Whether its a backend service, ML pipeline, or
      analytics workflow, I learn by mapping the system end-to-end.

  <div class="block">
    <h2>My Practical Learning Loop</h2>

    <div class="loop">
      <div class="step">Understand the core concept</div>
      <div class="step">Break it into components</div>
      <div class="step">Apply it in a small implementation</div>
      <div class="step">Observe failure or limitations</div>
      <div class="step">Refine understanding</div>
      <div class="step">Build something usable</div>
    </div>

    <p class="note">
      This loop ensures knowledge sticks because its tied to execution,
      not memorization.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <h2>Theoretical Depth Without Mugging</h2>
    <p>
      I dont memorize formulas or APIs blindly. I focus on understanding
      trade-offs, assumptions, and real-world constraints. This allows me to
      recall concepts naturally during implementation instead of relying on
      rote memory.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="block highlight">
    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>
      This learning system lets me adapt quickly to new tools, domains, and
      problem spaces. I am not tied to a specific stack. I am comfortable
      learning whatever the problem demands.
