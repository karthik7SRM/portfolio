    <h2>Who is this portfolio for?</h2>
    <p>
      This portfolio is for anyone interested in understanding how I think,
      build, and learn — recruiters, peers, juniors, or professionals exploring
      my work out of curiosity.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h2>Is this just a showcase or real work?</h2>
    <p>
      Everything here is based on real projects, real constraints, and real
      execution. I focus on building systems that work end-to-end rather than
      isolated demos or theory-only exercises.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h2>Can I learn from your projects or approach?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes. Many of the projects and explanations are intentionally structured
      to reflect how problems are approached in practical environments. Feel
      free to explore, analyze, and adapt ideas where useful.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h2>Are you tied to a single domain?</h2>
    <p>
      No. I work across domains like data, backend systems, analytics, and
      applied ML. My focus is on problem-solving and system design rather than
      a single tool or technology.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq highlight">
    <h2>Can I reach out even if I’m not recruiting?</h2>
    <p>
      Absolutely. If something here resonates — a project, an idea, or an
      approach — you’re welcome to reach out for discussion or exchange of
      ideas.

    <p class="note">
      I may not always respond instantly, but I do read messages thoughtfully.
