  <h1>Hackathon Teammate FAQ</h1>
  <p>For teams looking to collaborate seriously.</p>
</section>

<section class="content">

  <div class="faq">
    <h2>Who should reach out?</h2>
    <p>
      Teams or individuals who are serious about building a complete solution
      — not just submitting something last minute. I work best in environments
      where roles, timelines, and expectations are clear.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h2>What role do you expect in the team?</h2>
    <p>
      I’m comfortable joining as a <strong>Team Lead</strong> or taking up a
      <strong>clearly defined technical role</strong>.  
      What matters more to me is ownership and accountability rather than title.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h2>What domains are you open to?</h2>
    <p>
      I’m open to collaborating across domains — data, backend, analytics,
      ML-driven systems, or product-oriented builds. I adapt quickly as long as
      the problem statement is meaningful and execution-focused.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq">
    <h2>Availability & commitment</h2>
    <p>
      If I commit to a hackathon, I stay involved end-to-end. I prefer fewer
      collaborations with higher quality outcomes over juggling multiple teams
      without impact.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq highlight">
    <h2>How can you contact me?</h2>
    <p>
      You can reach out directly via:
    </p>

    <ul class="contact">
      <li>LinkedIn (preferred for first contact)</li>
      <li>WhatsApp (for active collaborations)</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">
      I’m currently open to discussions and will respond promptly.
    </p>
