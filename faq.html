<section class="faq">

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What roles are you targeting?</h3>
    <p>
      I’m primarily targeting roles in <strong>Data Analytics, Data Science,
      Machine Learning Engineering, and Software Engineering</strong>.
      I align myself based on the problem space — systems-heavy roles,
      data-driven roles, or hybrid product teams.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Are you more into Data Science or Software Engineering?</h3>
    <p>
      I don’t see them as isolated tracks. I focus on <strong>building systems
      that use data</strong>. I’m comfortable writing backend logic, designing
      pipelines, and integrating ML or analytics where it makes sense —
      not forcing models where they don’t belong.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Do you have real-world or production-style experience?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. My projects are designed end-to-end — data ingestion, processing,
      modeling, visualization, and decision output. I’ve worked with
      monitoring stacks (Grafana, Prometheus, Loki), analytics dashboards,
      and ML pipelines that resemble real backend systems rather than
      notebook-only work.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How strong are your fundamentals?</h3>
    <p>
      I have strong foundations in <strong>C, C++, Java, Python</strong>,
      core DSA concepts, and system-oriented thinking. I actively balance
      fundamentals with applied projects to avoid shallow, resume-only skills.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Have you worked in teams?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. I’ve led a <strong>9-member data science team</strong> in an
      AICTE-recognized internship project. I’ve handled task ownership,
      technical alignment, missed deadlines, and delivery pressure —
      not just ideal team scenarios.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What makes you different from other students?</h3>
    <p>
      I focus on <strong>execution over certificates</strong>. I build complete
      systems, document my thinking, lead when required, and make my work
      visible. I optimize for long-term engineering growth, not short-term
      resume hacks.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What opportunities are you open to?</h3>
    <p>
      I’m open to <strong>internships, part-time roles, full-time roles,
      and remote opportunities</strong>, depending on the learning curve
      and problem complexity involved.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How quickly can you adapt to a new stack or domain?</h3>
    <p>
      Very quickly. My learning approach is system-first — understanding
      inputs, outputs, constraints, and trade-offs. This lets me adapt
      to new tools without being dependent on specific frameworks.
